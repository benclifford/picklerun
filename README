picklerun
=========

Run function invocations remotely inside pickle deserialization

Usage:

```
from picklerun import picklerun

@picklerun
def myfunc(x):
    print("HI!")
    return x+1

bytestream = myfunc(3)

import pickle
assert pickle.loads(bytestream) == 3+1
```

BUGS
====

This gets source using dill.source. That has several problems:

* That doesn't work right for me in interactive sessions - it loses the
  `return x+1` in the above example.

* it is awkward to remove the decorator from the source code. Right now
  a literal `@picklerun` is removed if present, but using any other
  naming won't work - such as `@picklerun.picklerun` or:
  ```
  from picklerun import picklerun as p
  
  @p
  def myfunc():
      ...
  ```
